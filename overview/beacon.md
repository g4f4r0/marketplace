## What you get

Status lives in the sidebar footer. Open it for CPU, per-core load, memory, swap, root disk use, network rates, top processes, and uptime on the machine that runs BB. The popover samples only while it is on screen.

`bb beacon snapshot` prints the same numbers in a terminal. Add `--json` for the full structured reading. `bb beacon health` reports pressure and exits 2 when a reading is critical.

Turn on background monitoring to watch CPU and memory every 30 seconds while Status is closed. Sustained overload can send an in-app toast. BB has to be open and visible to show it. There is no OS push and no third-party monitor.

## How it works

Dashboard colors turn amber at 75% and red at 95%. CLI health warns at 85% and goes critical at 95%. It also compares five-minute load with core count. Background alerts wait a full minute of samples at higher thresholds. Those scales are independent on purpose.

Metrics stay on the BB server. Chart history is memory-only and expires when nobody is looking. Beacon never calls an external API. It does not change server settings, enable swap, or kill processes.

## Requirements

Needs BB 0.43 or newer. It inspects only the BB server host, not other enrolled machines or containers. Detailed network rates need Linux. A process can show more than 100% CPU because that figure is a lifetime average relative to one core.

No account, API key, or extra install.
